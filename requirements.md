🛠️ **Technical Requirements**

1. **Database Management**
   - Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
   - **Required tables**:
     - Users (guests and hosts)
     - Properties
     - Bookings
     - Reviews
     - Payments

2. **API Development**
   - Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
   - Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
     - **GET** (retrieve data)
     - **POST** (create data)
     - **PUT/PATCH** (update data)
     - **DELETE** (remove data)
   - Use **GraphQL** for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Use **JWT** for secure user sessions.
   - Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to differentiate permissions between:
     - Guests
     - Hosts
     - Admins

4. **File Storage (Scenario based)**
   - Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**. 
   - For implementation, we will use file storage.

5. **Third-Party Services**
   - Use email services like **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for email notifications.

6. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Implement global error handling for APIs.

🚀 **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Scalability**
   - Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
   - Enable horizontal scaling using **load balancers**.

2. **Security**
   - Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using **encryption**.
   - Implement **firewalls** and **rate limiting** to prevent malicious activities.

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use **caching tools** like **Redis** to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
   - Optimize **database queries** to reduce server load.

4. **Testing**
   - Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like **pytest**.
   - Include **automated API testing** to ensure endpoints function as expected.
